# 🧠 Bucket Memory Visualizer

**Bucket Memory Visualizer** is an interactive, web-based simulator for visualizing **page replacement algorithms** in operating systems, including **FIFO** and **LRU**. It helps students and developers understand how memory management works in a visual and step-by-step manner.

## 🌟 Features

- Visualize memory frames ("buckets") as pages are referenced.
- Supports two key algorithms:
  - First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
  - Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Step-by-step or instant simulation.
- Interactive GUI with statistics:
  - Page Faults
  - Page Hits
- Live event log of all actions.
- Downloadable simulation report in **PDF** format.
- Adjustable simulation speed.
